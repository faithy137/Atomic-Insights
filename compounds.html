	<h2> Sodium Chloride </h2>
<p>
    <b> What is Sodium Chloride? </b>
	</p>
	<p>
    Sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt, is an ionic compound with the chemical formula NaCl.
	It consists of equal amounts of sodium and chloride ions and occurs naturally as the mineral halite.
	Sodium chloride is used as a condiment, food preservative, and is essential for various bodily functions.
	</p>
    
	<p>
    <b> Why is it important? </b>
	</p>
    Table salt, or sodium chloride, is a mineral that is essential for human life. It is found in the blood and tissues of the body and helps regulate blood pressure and fluid balance. Salt also contains iodine, which is another essential nutrient. Other health benefits of salt include:
    <ul>
        <li>Supporting healthy digestion</li>                        
        <li>Facilitating body movement</li>
        <li>Supporting heart health</li>
        <li>Helping prevent iodine deficiency</li>
        <li>An important element of rehydration</li>
        <li>Helping reduce diabetes risk</li>

	<h2> Ammonia </h2>
<p>
	<b> What is Ammonia? </b>
	</p>
	<p>
    Ammonia is a colorless, pungent gas with the formula NH3, composed of nitrogen and hydrogen. It is the simplest stable compound of these elements and a common nitrogenous waste in nature. It dissolves readily in water and can be stored as a liquid at high pressure. It is used as a fertilizer and a starting material for many nitrogen compounds. It is also produced by bacteria in the intestines when digesting protein and processed in the liver into urea.
    </p>
	<p>
    <b> Why is it important? </b>
	</p>
Ammonia is important for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>It serves as a chemical building block for commercial and household products, including fertilizers and cleaning supplies.</li>
<li>It is used as a refrigerant, stabilizer, neutralizer, and purifier in food transport and water treatment.</li>
<li>Mass production of ammonia has improved crop yields and sustained a large population by making fertilizers.</li>
<li>It is used in the manufacturing of plastics, explosives, textiles, pesticides, dyes, and other chemicals.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b> Where to find it? </b>
</p>
Ammonia can be found in the following places:
<ul>
<li>Naturally in the environment, including air, soil, water, plants, and animals.</li>
<li>As a byproduct of biological processes by bacteria in soil and water.</li>
<li>In industrial production through the Haber-Bosch process.</li>
<li>In fertilizers and pharmaceuticals</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b> How to use Ammonia </b>
</p>
To use ammonia for cleaning, you can follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Mix ¼ cup of ammonia with 1 gallon of water to create a mildew-killing solution. Spray it on mildewed surfaces, let it sit for 15 minutes, and then wipe with a clean cloth.</li>
<li>For glass and mirrors, mix one part clear household ammonia with 10 parts water. Wipe down the surface with the solution and a clean cloth or squeegee.</li>
<li>For stained clothing, use a half-strength solution of ammonia and water to remove perspiration, blood, urine, and pencil marks before laundering.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Water</h2>
<p>
	<b> What is Water? </b>
    Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. It is a 
	transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance. It is the 
	main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living 
	organisms (in which it acts as a solvent). It is vital for all known life forms, 
	despite not providing food energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, 
	H2O indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen 
	atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the 
	oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°. In liquid form, H2O is also called "water" at standard temperature and pressure.

	<p>
	Health Effects of Water
	<ul>
<li>Maintain the health and integrity of every cell in the body.</li>
<li>Keep the bloodstream liquid enough to flow through blood vessels.</li>
<li>Help eliminate the by-products of the body’s metabolism, excess
electrolytes (for example, sodium and potassium), and urea, which is a
waste product formed through the processing of dietary protein.</li>
<li>Regulate body temperature through sweating.</li>
<li>Moisten mucous membranes (such as those of the lungs and mouth).</li>
<li>Lubricate and cushion joints.</li>
<li>Reduce the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs), such as cystitis by
keeping the bladder clear of bacteria.</li>
<li>Aid digestion and prevent constipation.</li>
<li>Moisturise the skin to maintain its texture and appearance.</li>
<li>Carry nutrients and oxygen to cells.</li>
<li>Serve as a shock absorber inside the eyes, spinal cord and in the
amniotic sac surrounding the foetus in pregnancy.</li>
    </ul>

<h2><a href="Watercycle.html">Water Cycle</a></h2>
</p>

<img src=cycle.png Water Cycle height = "300" px width="500" px/>

<p>
The water cycle (or hydrologic cycle or hydrological cycle), is a
biogeochemical cycle that involves the continuous movement of water
on, above and below the surface of the Earth. The mass of water on
Earth remains fairly constant over time. However, the partitioning of the
water into the major reservoirs of ice, fresh water, salt water and
atmospheric water is variable and depends on climatic variables. The
water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to ocean,
or from the ocean to the atmosphere. The processes that drive these
movements are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation,
sublimation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface flow. In doing so,
the water goes through different forms: liquid, solid (ice) and vapor. The
ocean plays a key role in the water cycle as it is the source of 86% of
global evaporation.

<b> Uses of Water </b>
</p>
<p>
Domestic uses of water:
<ul>
<li>15 % of water is consumed for domestic purpose. Water is used for
drinking, bathing, cooking food and washing dishes, clothes, fruits,
vegetables and brushing teeth.</li>
</ul>
Water use for agriculture:
<ul>
<li>Agriculture is the largest consumer of water. About 70% of water is used
for irrigation. Water is necessary for gardening, farming and fisheries. Plants require water to grow. During the process of photosynthesis, they consume
water. To yield crops, fruits, flowers, vegetables they need sufficient water,
manure, sunlight and oxygen.</li>
</ul>
Industrial uses of water:
<ul>
<li>It is either used in creating or to cool the equipment used for creating the
product. Industrial water is used for washing, cooling, processing,
transporting, diluting or fabricating of a product. The maximum amount of
water is used in the production of chemical, paper and food.</li>

<li>Other uses are – it is used in transportation, manufacturing, hydroelectric
power, removal of body wastes, tourism and recreation.</li>
</ul>
